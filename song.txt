[Verse 1]
Comin' on to the light of day
We’ve got many moons that are deep at play
So I keep an eye on the shadow's smile
To see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinning out, head is on my heart
It's like a bit of light 
And a touch of dark
You got a sneak attack from the zodiac
But I see your eyes spark
Keep the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
Oh what do you say girl?

[Chorus]
Yeah, you don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are 
Part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are 
Part of my design

[Verse 2]
Stumble down to the parking lot
You got no time for the afterthought
You're like ice cream for an astronaut
Well that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and...
Find a world at your command
Layin’ the hand, girl

[Chorus]
You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are 
Part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are 
Part of my design
